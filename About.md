# About me

Creative thinker. End to end solution designer. Poblem solver.

I thrive on new challenges and pushing technology to the limits. Container evangelist, javascript aficionado, open-source community lover, and tea drinker; I am powered by great ideas, inspiring people to action, and a strong team.

In this "new-age" digital world, we must embrace all the newest and greatest technologies to truly make a difference in whatever we're doing, wherever we're doing it.
