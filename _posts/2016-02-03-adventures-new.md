As my [last](http://www.jonathanben.net/feel-the-fear-and-do-it-anyway/) blog mentioned, last week I closed up shop at Burberry after a heart-warming farewell and the most wonderful send off, and today I am excited to tell you all about my next move.

I will be joing Zooz as their VP of Architecture & Data and I'm so excited to share this journey with you through my blog. I'm hoping I will be able to write more about the things I'm learning and the challenges I face.

Until then, Peace.
