After a lot of excitement last month, the Akamai OPEN API library I created for node, with many pull requests and open issues has been given to Akamai to continue it's life as an official API client.

We're working through specifics at the moment surrounding the licensing changes which were made to make sure it remains as open as possible; I look forward to sharing more news with you when I have it soon!

Thanks to the folks over at Akamai for making it happen.

Head over to here Edgegrid-node on Github to check it out.
