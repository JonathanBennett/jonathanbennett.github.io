Humans are bizarre. 

Frankly, I could leave the post there, but I'm not sure how I feel about being so cryptic, at least not today. Usually I'm so happy posting something out to the ether and secretly wondering "I hope someone reads that and wonders what I'm talking about - how _deep_ am I?" but right now I feel like explaining myself.

For those who know me, the last year has propelled me through the most phenomenal growth, or at least so I'm told. I moved jobs and indeed practically shifted countries, I suffered many hardships which will forever alter me as a person and struggled to keep going when I felt my worst but yet here we are, May 2016 and it's as if I could be a year ago today and feel as if I've looped right back to the beginning.

I'm good at two things; 1) I'm worryingly black and white, a good sense of right and wrong, and 2) pretending to not be human.

Let me tell you why, in a nutshell, I pretend to not be human. The bottom line is *Humans Suck*. I really want to believe they don't, I really want to be part of the growth of humans and generally mentoring them, but time and time again I'm proven that humans suck, so naturally I want to distance myself from them. If you know the fire is going to burn you, why would you put your hand in it?

Today was a painful reminder that I, in fact, am a human.
